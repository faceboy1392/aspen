# aspen stuff

Ok so ideally, I want it to be a statically typed language. If I can get it to run on LLVM that would be nice to get it really fast, but first I probably gotta get good at C++. I want it to have relatively simple and consistent syntax, not anything verbose.

Also, one thing that would be nice is some built-in io and graphics support in the stdlib, could be good to have. If I can figure out how it works, it would also be nice to have a simple "task" system for threading and subprocesses
